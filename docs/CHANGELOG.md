## 49.1-rc2

<p>New features</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for end timestamp sync for Line-by-Line sync page (formerly LRC Sync 
  Page). This mode allows the line to have both start and end timestamps. This would help
  users to make stricter lyrics (or subtitles) for formats that support end tags (such as
  SRT)</li>
  <li>Filtering in Library by SRT lyrics. Would be removed in future updates and replaced
  with filtering by lyrics fullness (None, Plain, Line-by-Line (Start only), Line-by-Line
  (Full), Word-by-Word (Start only), Word-by-Word (Full))</li>
</ul>

## 49.1-rc1

<p>New features</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for SRT lyrics. For now the end timestamp is taken from the next line
  start timestamp</li>
  <li>Added functionality for export buttons of Lyric Rows in About File dialog</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>On Linux the app now trying to use Desktop Portal to show files in file manager.
  This removes app requirement to have `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.FileManager1` sandbox
  permission. Hope soon I find the way to remove `host` and `gvfsd` permissions from
  sandbox</li>
</ul>
<p>Translations</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added Indonesian translation</li>
</ul>

## 49

<p>New Library approach: Previously, Chronograph has manipulated different
directories user stores files in. Now we move from this approach to new Library.
You select a folder in which you want to create a new library, then import files
in it, and Chronograph then uses this Library and its files.</p>
<p>New Chronograph's own lyric format Chronie. Its main goal to be compatible with every
other format Chronograph supports. Since barely all formats use Line-by-line or
Word-by-word syncing and either only start or both start and end timestamps, Chronie
combines all these approaches and store ALL of them simultaniously. Chronie can be
converted to any lyric format and then exported, at the same time, it is exportable
itself.</p>
<p>Since most of the users, I guess would only use one library, it has tags you
can assign to a track in a Library. Sidebar, which previously stored saved
locations (directories) now stores tags and allow fast filtering among them.</p>
<p>These are removed: List View mode, all files related settings.</p>
<p>Don't forget to check Preferences after the update, since many changes were
made to the app schema</p>
<p>New features</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to sort by Title, Artist and Album both A-Z and Z-A</li>

<p>A new eLRC format support!</p>
<p>Added support for advanced syncing Word-by-Word (WBW).</p>
<p>WBW syncing has 2 steps: Edit the lyrics you gonna sync and... sync them. Editing lyrics while syncing is not possible in WBW mode.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, LRClib does not have support for eLRC lyrics, so WBW lyrics aren't possible to upload to LRClib :(</p>
<p>Navigation in WBW syncing mode happens by using Alt+{arrow_keys}, so using WBW on mobile will be too overwhelming, so it's not recommended.</p>
<p>If the lyrics you've provided are partially synced then the app will start the synchronization from the first unsynced word.</p>
<p>Now there will be two types of files: eLRCs with eLRC prefix set up and plain .lrc</p>
<p>Don't forget to check Preferences after the update :)</p>
